Emotion recognition method based on physiological signals can directly obtain people's emotion states and avoid pretending expression and emotional expression disorder. In physiological signals, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is commonly used in the emotion evaluation, and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signal is related to people's excited feeling. This paper proposed an emotion recognition method based on EEG and HRV to do the emotion recognition work. This method aims to solve the accuracy problem of instant emotion recognition, and achieve a higher accuracy. According to Russell's model of emotion, the system in this paper use two dimensions, “valence” and “arousal”, to describe people's emotion. The emotion recognition system we proposed combines more advanced neural network models and eigenvalues closely related to emotional states. This system uses DenseNet as the neural network model for machine learning process, which is more accurate than the general deep neural network. Using differential entropy as the main eigenvalue makes the system's ability to analyze emotions based on EEG more efficient.","tags":null,"title":"A Real-Time and Two-Dimensional Emotion Recognition System Based on EEG and HRV Using Machine Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Abstract The purpose of this study is to develop a control system for walking assistive robot that enables the user to keep positive emotions and maintain high levels of motivation during exercise.

Most conventional aerial robots are driven by propellers. However, the use of propellers is accompanied by noise and danger due to the high-speed rotation. Once the operating propeller accidentally touches persons or objects, injury or economic loss may result, which makes the propeller-based aerial robots usually unsuitable for indoor environment application. Biomimetics in propulsion inspires us to solve the above limitation.\nThe movement of manta rays Overview: In this study, we proposed a new aerial robot that mimics the manta ray’s movement and is suitable for indoor-environment applications. The robot mainly comprises a lightweight helium-filled ballonet, a noiseless flapping-wing actuator, a pitch control mechanism, and a tail-like rudder. In the flight tests, the prototypes not only demonstrated controlled and flexible flight but also were able to execute manta-like high manoeuvring motions. Long operation time was ensured due to the helium ballonet body, low-frequency flapping wing, and low-power electronics. Overall, the developed bioinspired robot is featured as energy-efficient, noiseless, and harmless for human-robot interaction. It can further bring new applications for aerial robotics, such as robot therapy (as comfort pets), long-time surveillance and event observation, and interactable and dynamic advertising media.\nOverview of iManta iManta performs high manoeuvring motions iManta shown in “Feng Ru Cup” Science and Technology Festival (Beijing, China) Features Energy-efficient Noiseless Suitable for indoor environment Harmless for human-robot interaction The interaction between humans and iManta Future Applications Interactable and dynamic advertising media Robot therapy (as comfort pets) Long-time surveillance and event observation The application as dynamic advertising media The application as comfort pets The application for surveillance and event observation ","date":1655724363,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655724363,"objectID":"8a9412cd988aaf360ccc1894a6a72f8b","permalink":"https://mingyangxu.netlify.app/project/imanta/","publishdate":"2022-06-20T11:26:03.274Z","relpermalink":"/project/imanta/","section":"project","summary":"**(Video)** A new airship robot that mimics the manta ray’s movement and is suitable for indoor-environment applications","tags":["Bioinspired Robotics","Aerial Robotics"],"title":"★ iManta: a Manta ray-inspired Aerial Robot","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Mingyang Xu worked in Recording Studio of Beihang University as a student cadre from Sep. 2016 to Jun. 2017, during which he recorded and produced music for bands and individuals.\n","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://mingyangxu.netlify.app/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Student Cadre","tags":[],"title":"Music and Recording Studio","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?

However, the possibility of off-field landings is severely limited by non-flat landing areas. Some example landing areas include great slopes, rocky grounds, and stairs. VTOL-type aerial robots that use conventional skids or landing wheels have poor ability to adapt to uneven and steep terrain, causing safety problems and economic losses. Aiming at the above limitations, we proposed a novel terrain-adaptive aerial robot. This aerial robot features robotic landing gear, which consists of four legs. Based on the force, attitude, and height data collected by the sensors, the landing gear could be automatically adjusted to conform closely with the ground, thus keeping the robot horizontal and balanced during landing. Finally, the laboratory experiment test and outfield flight test have been done to verify the results of the design and theory modelling.\nVideo Overview of developed prototypes Process of the terrain-adaptive landing mode ","date":1526789543,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526789543,"objectID":"2103d2b868ca20fc61901d9a9bd70ff9","permalink":"https://mingyangxu.netlify.app/project/terrain-adaptive-aerial-robot/","publishdate":"2018-05-20T04:12:23.346Z","relpermalink":"/project/terrain-adaptive-aerial-robot/","section":"project","summary":"**(Video)** A aerial robot features robotic landing gear, which can be automatically adjusted to keep the robot horizontal during landing","tags":["Bioinspired Robotics","Aerial Robotics","Robot Control"],"title":"Terrain-adaptive Aerial Robot with Legged Landing Gear","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Abstract Missions for long-endurance fixed-wing aircraft have been limited by an inability to take off from constricted spaces. Although vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircrafts can hover, take off, and land vertically without relying on a runway, they usually present less aerodynamic efficiency, duration of flight, and carrying capacity because they carry additional motors, batteries and propellers. Therefore, we developed a multicopter-based launch system for fix-wing aircrafts to provide them with a VTOL capability. The fix-wing aircraft to be launched is attached to the underside of the system by the ground crew. The launch system then carries the attached aircraft up into the air. Once at a sufficient altitude, the launch system revs its engines up to a certain speed and then releases the attached aircraft by ejection system. After the release, the launch system returns to the ground crew. Finally, the aircraft can be recovered by a parachute after conducting the task. The multicopter-based launch system can enhance the capability of fix-wing aircrafts to take off from complex terrain.\nV﻿ideo ","date":1499314781,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499314781,"objectID":"bdeebb10db884d7912def1c5e1990b0c","permalink":"https://mingyangxu.netlify.app/project/quadrotor-based-launch-system-for-fixed-wing-aircraft/","publishdate":"2017-07-06T04:19:41.234Z","relpermalink":"/project/quadrotor-based-launch-system-for-fixed-wing-aircraft/","section":"project","summary":"**(Video)** A multicopter-based launch system for fix-wing aircrafts was developed to provide them with a VTOL capability","tags":["Aerial Robotics"],"title":"Quadrotor Based Launch System for Fixed-wing Aircraft","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Members: Mingyang Xu\nSupervisor: Prof. Guijiang Duan\nOverview In this project, a knowledge base management system for components selection was designed.
